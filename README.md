# jetkvm-desktop

A native desktop client for JetKVM with local discovery, direct connect, remote control, and core settings in one window.

## What It Does

- Finds JetKVM devices on your local network
- Connects directly by hostname, mDNS name, or IP
- Shows the remote video feed in a native desktop window
- Sends keyboard and mouse input to the target machine
- Supports mouse back/forward side buttons in the native client, unlike the browser UI
- Prompts for a password when the device requires it
- Exposes the main settings and connection stats without opening the browser UI

## Getting Started

Open the launcher:

```bash
jetkvm-desktop
```

Connect straight to a known device:

```bash
jetkvm-desktop jetkvm.local
jetkvm-desktop 192.168.1.50
jetkvm-desktop http://192.168.1.50
```

If the device requires a password, the app will ask for it.

The experimental USB-network settings UI is disabled by default because current KVM targets do not support it yet. To expose it at runtime, set `JETKVM_DESKTOP_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_USB_NETWORK=1`.

To profile a running client, set `JETKVM_DESKTOP_PPROF` to a listen address (for example `127.0.0.1:6060`) and use `go tool pprof http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/profile`.

Video is decoded with openh264 by default. On Linux, building with `go build -tags ffmpeg ./cmd/jetkvm-desktop` links the system's FFmpeg libraries instead (the `libavcodec` development files must be installed), which decode on the GPU through VA-API where available and fall back to FFmpeg's software decoder. Set `JETKVM_DESKTOP_DECODER=openh264` or `software` to override the choice at runtime.

## Inside the App

Once connected, the app keeps video, input, stats, and the core device settings in the same window, so the common JetKVM workflow stays fast and desktop-native.
